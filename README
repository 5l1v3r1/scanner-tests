= Web Scanner Security Tests =

These files make up a collection of very cheap and messy PHP scripts meant to look like a vulnerable Web application.  They were originally created to help with quick functional testing of the [http://websecuritytool.codeplex.com|Watcher Web security tool] set of rules.  Each file in turn represents one test for one Watcher check.  By loading the index.html file you will be presented with a list of all tests hyperlinked for quick loading.
